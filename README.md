Component Descriptions
Frontend (Next.js):

Interactive UI for browsing products, managing orders, and user authentication.
Fetches and displays dynamic data from backend APIs in real time.
Sanity CMS:

Backend for managing products, user data, orders, and inventory.
Provides APIs for seamless data integration with the frontend.
Third-Party APIs:

Shipment Tracking (ShipEngine): Offers real-time shipment updates and tracking.
Payment Gateway (Stripe): Ensures secure payment processing and confirmation.
Authentication (Clerk):

Manages user registration, login, and session handling.
Securely integrates user data with Sanity CMS.
Key Workflows
User Registration

Users register via the frontend using Clerk.
Registration details are stored securely in Sanity CMS.
Product Browsing

Users explore product categories via the frontend.
Sanity CMS APIs fetch and display product details dynamically.
Order Placement

Users add products to their cart and proceed to checkout.
Order details are processed through Sanity CMS and payments are handled via Stripe.
A confirmation email is sent, and the order is recorded in the database.
Shipment Tracking

Shipment details are managed using ShipEngine after order placement.
Real-time tracking information is displayed on the frontend.
Inventory Management

Sanity CMS handles product stock updates.
Users can add only in-stock items to their cart, while out-of-stock items are saved to the wishlist.

Edit
import { defineField, defineType } from "sanity";
import { TrolleyIcon } from "@sanity/icons";

export const productTypes = defineType({
  name: "product",
  title: "Products",
  type: "document",
  icon: TrolleyIcon,
  fields: [
    defineField({ name: "name", title: "Product Name", type: "string", validation: (Rule) => Rule.required() }),
    defineField({ name: "slug", title: "Slug", type: "slug", options: { source: "name" }, validation: (Rule) => Rule.required() }),
    defineField({ name: "price", title: "Price", type: "number", validation: (Rule) => Rule.required().min(0) }),
    defineField({ name: "image", title: "Product Image", type: "image", options: { hotspot: true } }),
    defineField({ name: "inStock", title: "In Stock", type: "boolean", initialValue: true }),
    defineField({ name: "stock", title: "Stock Quantity", type: "number", validation: (Rule) => Rule.min(0) }),
  ],
  preview: {
    select: { title: "name", media: "image", subtitle: "price" },
    prepare({ title, subtitle, media }) {
      return { title, subtitle: `$${subtitle}`, media };
    },
  },
});
Technical Roadmap
Development Phase
Authentication: Implement Clerk for user registration and integrate it with Sanity CMS.
Product Management: Develop APIs to fetch and display product data dynamically.
Cart/Wishlist: Enable adding/removing items in real-time with stock validation.
Payment Integration: Use Stripe for secure payment processing.
Shipment Tracking: Integrate ShipEngine to track shipments.
Testing Phase
Conduct end-to-end tests for user registration, product browsing, order placement, and shipment tracking.
Perform security audits for sensitive data handling, including payment processing.
Launch Phase
Deploy the platform on a scalable hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.
Optimize performance based on user feedback and demand.
Conclusion
This document serves as a blueprint for building the Bandage Online Shopping Platform, ensuring a seamless eCommerce experience with robust authentication, efficient inventory management, and real-time shipment tracking.
